Change-Password
===============

This is a small Bonita process to use in the Portal, so users can reset or change their Password by themself (this feature is not native in the Portal)

Just import the .bos file in your Studio, build it, and import it in your production's Bonita Portal. Please do not forget to set the user right so everybody can start this process in the Portal.
